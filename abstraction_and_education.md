# Abstraction and Education: A Talk

Bosses love training, but they hate education. Training leads to tangible outputs, and tangible outputs can be sold. Selling things leads to increases in shareholder value. 

Dyslexics love abstraction. It allows us to roam up and down the levels of abstraction, rapidly switching between topic areas, and forming new connections. They prefer to be out of the fine, granular detail. In fact, they would avoid it entirely if they could. Autistics prefer to be at the lower levels, in the detail. In many ways, this makes autistic people much omre employable than dyslexics.
