The difference between the performance of someone who needs a good report for their career, and someone who doesn't, is quite substantial in the military. Likewise there are those who do their utmost because they see or feel the intrinsic value in what they are doing. For myself, I am not sure that I have ever only performed well for the report. I think that I need to be able to see and feel the underlying purpose to what is being done. This is worth remembering for the future if I do one day find myself in the position of trying to start a company that is based on or around something I deeply care about. Because, if I get that right, *everything* will be based on that thing that thing I am trying to do. There will be nothing extraneous. Everything will ultimately either live or die on the success of the enterprise itself.
