What is the psychology of programming? How do we think about thinking about computers? In a sense computer programming is about the human brain to computer interface.


Use of text in the *nix system / posix. Text is probably the easiest intermediary between human minds and machines. Language can be parsed into computer language through the use of various interpreters, in a way that other forms (graphical user interfaces, mouse clicks) might not be able to do so easily. That being said, images, GUIs, mouse clicks are all able to be encoded. So perhaps it's the ability of text to be easily used through the command line that makes it the sweet spot between the two. After all, it's relatively unchanged in the last 50 years.
