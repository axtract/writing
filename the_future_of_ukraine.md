> "There are no facts, only interpretations." - Friedrich Nietzsche

Starting an essay of this nature immediately begs the question: what on earth could there be that is factual enough to be able to stake into the ground as a point of departure? Within this conflict to date, everything has been a media campaign, or a misinformation campaign, of a counterintelligence plan. The history that Russia's invasion was based on is itself of extremely doubtful truth. And at the same time, Ukraine is a country that is far from perfect in terms of its track history on corruption and general oligarchism.
