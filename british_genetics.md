# British Genetic History

Annelise had a fascinating idea at breakfast today (25 August '24). She was pondering the idea that it is in our very recent genetic past that we were the nation that had a far more globally dominant empire than even the current American hegemony has. We got China addicted to opium, and we fully dominated India. 

Her point was that those who came to the UK were doing so out of an expeditionary spirit - out of greed, essentially. Enterprising, looking for something further, something better. And they came to the UK, some of them settling in the country. They started to spread their expeditionary genes among us. The US, by contrast, was populated by indentured servants, transported to the US, by slaves, taken there against their will by slavers who had bought them from the Slave Coast of Africa, and religious extremists fleeing persecution. 

The echoes in the modern day of our genetic past. 

The British plan, the Americans execute.
