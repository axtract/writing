# Consciousness and Perception

We look at the world and seem naturally to categorise things. This is, in some ways, the first move of consciousness. We perceive, and first break things down into a category of 'one' - the book I am holding. It is one, unary thing. It also belongs to a group of other categories that I can make - a hand-bound book, or a spiral-bound book, or a book that I own, or a library book, or a category based on the subject matter. That allows me to make comparisons or see similarities with other things I own of the same category. The important thing to realise here, though is that all of that categorisation happens *in my own mind* - not in the outside world. There is no such 'thing' as a 'book' without conscious minds to perceive them. There is no intrinsic 'bookness' quality that could be observed under a microscope. But we all too easily ignore the difference - because what difference does it actually make to our own lives if the 'book' 'exists' or not? It exists within the human conscious context that we all live in - and for 99% of the time, that is all that matters ot humans. But it can impede our ability to make sense of the physical world. We too easily mistake a consciousness category for a human category, and vice versa.
