# Introduction

I'm nervous talking here. I'm quite sure that you will all think that I'm just another 'bro' who's come to technology because it's the 'cool' thing. 

Perhaps the main message I would like to convey: Allow yourself to be the largest instantiation of who and what you can be. This expression does not need to be dependent on others' reactions; the things that you do can remain forever behind closed doors. No one else ever needs to see it. But allow yourself to express it, and find a place to express and to store it. If you do something with it later, if you ever cross over into the world of other people, great. But the fact that you are not crossing over into that world, or do not want to, should not be used as an excuse never to express the fullest expression of your individual greatness. We are all far more capable, far more expansive than we realise. The first step is giving ourselves permission to express that. In my case, it is allowing myself to capture all of the random thoughts that enter my mind. The concepts that gestate in my unconscious and then find expression at the oddest moments. It is allowing myself the freedom to carry a notebook in situations where it is odd to do so - like out at dinner - and then allowing myself to capture in it the unusual thoughts, excellent snippets of conversation, that come up.
